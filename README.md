In this game, there are seven different animal shapes, players need use mouse to place the giving shapes on board and fullfill a row or columne of three same animal shapes to crush them, when crush the three same shapes, there will create new shapes to fill the eliminated part, and the player will gain 10 score, and the time I set is 100 seconds, when time reach, the game will end and jump to a result screen, the player can choose to restart or quit the game.
